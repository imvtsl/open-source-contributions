# My Open Source Contributions

This repository showcases some of my prominent contributions to various open-source projects. While these represent a selection of my work, I have contributed to additional issues and pull requests across other repositories, further demonstrating my ongoing engagement and collaboration with the open-source community. The repository is divided into two sections:

## 1. Contributions to Issues
In this section, I have listed some of my PRs to a few issues. Each entry provides a link to the issue and my corresponding pull request.

### Contributions:
| Repository | Issue | Pull Request | Status |  Comments |
|------------|-------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) | [BUG Parsing a GetResult returns NPE if "found" field is missing](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/14519) | [14552](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/14552) | PR Merged which led to Issue Successfully Resolved | |
| [opensearch-py](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py) | [BUG Collapse not preserved when chaining a Search instance](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/issues/769) | [771](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/pull/771) | PR Merged; Issue Later Reopened for Additional Scope | Addressed missing collapse property in `Search`, aligned with the original issue scope. The PR was merged and the issue was closed. Later, a maintainer reopened the issue to suggest additional support for `collapse` in `AsyncSearch`, which was clearly outside the scope of the original issue and my PR. |
| [opensearch-go](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-go) | [BUG opensearchapi.Client.Document.Delete bugged error handling (v4)](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-go/issues/582) | [592](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-go/pull/592) | PR Merged which led to Issue Successfully Resolved | |
| [opensearch-api-specification](link) | [Error responses missing in API specs](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-api-specification/issues/445) | [589](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-api-specification/pull/589) | PR Merged; Issue Ongoing | Identified the issue and contributed by adding error responses for several APIs. The issue remains open for error responses for remaining APIs. |
| [beam](https://github.com/apache/beam) | [Update Go protobuf package to new version](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21515) | [32045](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32045) | PR Merged which led to Issue Successfully Resolved | |
| [rueidis](https://github.com/redis/rueidis) | [how to add new index to old ones](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/issues/632) | [645](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/pull/645) | PR Merged; Issue Later Reopened for Additional Scope | Implemented `AlterIndex` functionality as agreed with maintainer. The PR was merged and the issue was closed. The scope was later expanded by the maintainer to include additional functionality (index creation, aliasing, and state management), which was not part of the original requirement. |
| [rueidis](https://github.com/redis/rueidis) | [Bug: FT.AlterIndex options doesn't support multiple options](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/issues/654) | [655](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/pull/655) | PR Merged which led to Issue Successfully Resolved | |
